# Contact Page Implementation Guide

## Overview

This guide provides detailed instructions for implementing the corrected contact page that matches the design shown in Image 2. The current contact.html page has an outdated structure (as shown in Image 1) and needs to be updated to maintain consistency with the rest of the site.

## Files Provided

1. **contact-final.html** - The complete, corrected HTML file for the contact page
2. **css/contact-page.css** - Custom CSS styles to match the design in Image 2
3. **js/contact-page.js** - Enhanced JavaScript functionality for the contact page

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create Required CSS and JavaScript Files

1. First, create the CSS file:
   - Create a file at `css/contact-page.css`
   - Copy the contents from the provided `css/contact-page.css` file in this repository

2. Create the JavaScript file:
   - Create a file at `js/contact-page.js`
   - Copy the contents from the provided `js/contact-page.js` file in this repository

### Step 2: Replace the Contact Page HTML

1. Make a backup of your existing `pages/contact.html` file.
2. Replace the content of `pages/contact.html` with the content from `pages/contact-final.html` provided in this repository.

### Step 3: Verify File Paths

Confirm that all file paths in the HTML are correct for your environment, particularly:

- CSS file paths
- JavaScript file paths
- Image paths 
- Link URLs

### Step 4: Test the Implementation

1. Load the contact page in different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
2. Test the responsive design by resizing the browser window
3. Verify that the form validation works correctly
4. Test the language selector to ensure it works properly
5. Verify that all links in the navigation menu work correctly

## Key Changes Made

### Navigation Structure

The navigation menu has been updated to include the "Our Staff" menu item, matching the structure shown in Image 2:

```html
<ul class="nav-list">
    <li><a href="../index.html" data-i18n="global.menu.home">Home</a></li>
    <li><a href="services.html" data-i18n="global.menu.services">Services</a></li>
    <li><a href="technology.html" data-i18n="global.menu.technology">Technology</a></li>
    <li><a href="our-staff.html" data-i18n="global.menu.staff">Our Staff</a></li>
    <li><a href="locations.html" data-i18n="global.menu.locations">Locations</a></li>
    <li><a href="contact.html" class="active" data-i18n="global.menu.contact">Contact</a></li>
</ul>
```

### Styling Improvements

The custom CSS file (`contact-page.css`) provides styling that:

1. Matches the horizontal navigation layout shown in Image 2
2. Properly styles the active menu item with an underline
3. Uses the correct green color for buttons and accents (`#8bc34a`)
4. Creates a responsive layout that works on mobile devices

### Form Enhancements

The contact form has been enhanced with:

1. Proper validation feedback
2. Improved accessibility attributes
3. Better form structure and styling
4. Custom success message handling

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Styles not applying correctly:**
   - Ensure the CSS file is properly linked in the HTML header
   - Check for any CSS caching issues by doing a hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)

2. **JavaScript functionality not working:**
   - Verify the JavaScript file is correctly linked at the bottom of the HTML file
   - Check the browser console for any JavaScript errors

3. **Navigation links not working:**
   - Confirm that all file paths in navigation links are correct for your environment
   - Make sure the "Our Staff" page exists at the specified location

4. **Internationalization issues:**
   - Ensure the i18n.js file is correctly loaded
   - Verify that all data-i18n attributes are properly set

## Additional Notes

1. The contact page now uses specific CSS and JavaScript files to avoid conflicts with other pages
2. The page is fully compatible with the existing internationalization system
3. All accessibility features have been maintained and enhanced
4. The layout is responsive and works on mobile devices
